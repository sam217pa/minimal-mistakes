The interest stems from a basic desire to learn more about evolutionary processes in humans and other organisms, and from the realization that inferences regarding selection may provide important functional information. This review provides a nonmathematical description of the issues involved in detecting selection from DNA sequences and SNP data and is intended for readers who are not familiar with population genetic theory. Particular attention is placed on issues relating to the analysis of large-scale genomic data sets.},

	abstract = {Meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) initiate crossover (CO) recombination, which is necessary for accurate chromosome segregation, but DSBs may also repair as non-crossovers (NCOs). Multiple recombination pathways with specific intermediates are expected to lead to COs and NCOs. We revisited the mechanisms of meiotic DSB repair and the regulation of CO formation, by conducting a genome-wide analysis of strand-transfer intermediates associated with recombination events. We performed this analysis in a SK1 {\texttimes} S288C Saccharomyces cerevisiae hybrid lacking the mismatch repair (MMR) protein Msh2, to allow efficient detection of heteroduplex DNAs (hDNAs). First, we observed that the anti-recombinogenic activity of MMR is responsible for a 20\% drop in CO number, suggesting that in MMR{\textendash}proficient cells some DSBs are repaired using the sister chromatid as a template when polymorphisms are present. Second, we observed that a large fraction of NCOs were associated with trans{\textendash}hDNA tracts constrained to a single chromatid. This unexpected finding is compatible with dissolution of double Holliday junctions (dHJs) during repair, and it suggests the existence of a novel control point for CO formation at the level of the dHJ intermediate, in addition to the previously described control point before the dHJ formation step. Finally, we observed that COs are associated with complex hDNA patterns, confirming that the canonical double-strand break repair model is not sufficient to explain the formation of most COs. We propose that multiple factors contribute to the complexity of recombination intermediates. These factors include repair of nicks and double-stranded gaps, template switches between non-sister and sister chromatids, and HJ branch migration. Finally, the good correlation between the strand transfer properties observed in the absence of and in the presence of Msh2 suggests that the intermediates detected in the absence of Msh2 reflect normal intermediates., Sexual reproduction consists in fusing two complementary gametes carrying only one set of chromosomes (haploids) to form a cell with two sets of homologous chromosomes (diploid). Gametes are generated through meiosis, a specialized cell division occurring in diploid organisms. For proper meiotic division to occur, homologous chromosomes need physical connections acquired through recombination that exchange chromosome arms (crossovers) and thereby contribute to genetic diversity. Recombination is induced by numerous chromosome breakages, but only a subset yields crossover recombinants, the remaining yielding non-crossover recombinants. Control of crossover formation is poorly understood. For this reason, precise knowledge of the meiotic recombination mechanisms is essential. Current models are based on studies performed at a few loci in model organisms. We revisited these models using an original approach that allowed us to study the DNA scars left at all chromosome breakage sites during single meioses in baker's yeast. We found that crossover formation is more dynamic than anticipated, which led us to propose variations of current crossover formation models. We also revealed that a significant fraction of non-crossovers do not arise from the canonical pathway, raising the possibility of a common pathway with crossover formation.},

	abstract = {The ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates ($\omega$) is often used to measure the strength of natural selection. However, $\omega$ may be influenced by linkage among different targets of selection, i.e. Hill-Robertson interference (HRI), which reduces the efficacy of selection. Recombination modulates the extent of HRI but may also affect $\omega$ by means of GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC), a process leading to a preferential fixation of G:C ({\textquotedblleft}strong{\textquotedblright}, S) over A:T ({\textquotedblleft}weak{\textquotedblright}, W) alleles. As HRI and gBGC can have opposing effects on $\omega$, it is essential to understand their relative impact to make proper inferences of $\omega$. We used a model that separately estimated S-to-S, S-to-W, W-to-S and W-to-W substitution rates in 8,423 avian genes in the Ficedula flycatcher lineage. We found that the W-to-S substitution rate was positively, and the S-to-W rate negatively, correlated with recombination rate, in accordance with gBGC but not predicted by HRI. The W-to-S rate further showed the strongest impact on both dN and dS. However, since the effects were stronger at 4-fold than at 0-fold degenerated sites, likely because the GC content of these sites is farther away from its equilibrium, $\omega$ slightly decreases with increasing recombination rate, which could falsely be interpreted as a consequence of HRI. We corroborated this hypothesis analytically and demonstrate that under particular conditions $\omega$ can decrease with increasing recombination rate. Analyses of the site-frequency spectrum showed that W-to-S mutations were skewed towards high, and S-to-W mutations towards low, frequencies, consistent with a prevalent gBGC-driven fixation bias.},

	abstract = {Language is a uniquely human trait likely to have been a prerequisite for the development of human culture. The ability to develop articulate speech relies on capabilities, such as fine control of the larynx and mouth, that are absent in chimpanzees and other great apes. FOXP2 is the first gene relevant to the human ability to develop language. A point mutation in FOXP2 co-segregates with a disorder in a family in which half of the members have severe articulation difficulties accompanied by linguistic and grammatical impairment. This gene is disrupted by translocation in an unrelated individual who has a similar disorder. Thus, two functional copies of FOXP2 seem to be required for acquisition of normal spoken language. We sequenced the complementary DNAs that encode the FOXP2 protein in the chimpanzee, gorilla, orang-utan, rhesus macaque and mouse, and compared them with the human cDNA. We also investigated intraspecific variation of the human FOXP2 gene. Here we show that human FOXP2 contains changes in amino-acid coding and a pattern of nucleotide polymorphism, which strongly suggest that this gene has been the target of selection during recent human evolution.},

At least in species with large populations, even synonymous mutations in exons are not neutral. By contrast, in mammals, neutrality of these mutations is still commonly assumed. However, new evidence indicates that even some synonymous mutations are subject to constraint, often because they affect splicing and/or mRNA stability. This has implications for understanding disease, optimizing transgene design, detecting positive selection and estimating the mutation rate.},

The RecA protein plays a central role in these repair pathways, and its biochemistry must be considered in this context. RecA protein promotes DNA strand exchange, a reaction that contributes to fork regression and DNA end invasion steps. RecA protein activities, especially formation and disassembly of its filaments, affect many additional steps. So far, Escherichia coli RecA appears to be unique among its nearly ubiquitous family of homologous proteins in that it possesses a motorlike activity that can couple the branch movement in DNA strand exchange to ATP hydrolysis. RecA is also a multifunctional protein, serving in different biochemical roles for recombinational processes, SOS induction, and mutagenic lesion bypass. New biochemical and structural information highlights both the similarities and distinctions between RecA and its homologs. Increasingly, those differences can be rationalized in terms of biological function.},

	abstract = {Author SummaryMammalian genomes show a very strong heterogeneity of base composition along chromosomes (the so-called isochores). The functional significance of these peculiar genomic landscapes is highly debated: do isochores confer some selective advantage, or are they simply the by-product of neutral evolutionary processes? To resolve this issue, we analyzed the pattern of substitution in the human genome by comparison with chimpanzee and macaque. We show that the evolution of base composition (GC-content) is essentially determined by the rate of recombination. This effect appears to be much stronger in male than in female germline, which rules out selective explanations for the evolution of isochores. We show that this impact of recombination is most probably a consequence of the process of biased gene conversion (BGC). This neutral process mimics the action of selection and can induce strong substitution hotspots within recombination hotspots, sometimes leading to the fixation of deleterious mutations. BGC appears to be one of the major factors driving genome evolution. It is therefore essential to take this process into account if we want to be able to interpret genome sequences.},

Understanding how and why selection acts has important potential applications, from understanding the mechanisms of disease and microbial resistance, to improving the design of transgenes and drugs.},

We identified 992 conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) with a significant excess of human-specific substitutions. These accelerated elements were disproportionately found near genes involved in neuronal cell adhesion. To assess the uniqueness of human noncoding evolution, we examined CNSs accelerated in chimpanzee and mouse. Although we observed a similar enrichment near neuronal adhesion genes in chimpanzee, the accelerated CNSs themselves exhibited almost no overlap with those in human, suggesting independent evolution toward different neuronal phenotypes in each species. CNSs accelerated in mouse showed no bias toward neuronal cell adhesion. Our results indicate that widespread cis-regulatory changes in human evolution may have contributed to uniquely human features of brain development and function.},

	abstract = {One of the oldest hypotheses for the advantage of recombination is that recombination allows beneficial mutations that arise in different individuals to be placed together on the same chromosome. Unless recombination occurs, one of the beneficial alleles is doomed to extinction, slowing the rate at which adaptive mutations are incorporated within a population. We model the effects of a modifier of recombination on the fixation probability of beneficial mutations when beneficial alleles are segregating at other loci. We find that modifier alleles that increase recombination do increase the fixation probability of beneficial mutants and subsequently hitchhike along as the mutants rise in frequency. The strength of selection favoring a modifier that increases recombination is proportional to $\lambda$2S$\delta$r/r when linkage is tight and $\lambda$2S3$\delta$r/N when linkage is loose, where $\lambda$ is the beneficial mutation rate per genome per generation throughout a population of size N, S is the average mutant effect, r is the average recombination rate, and $\delta$r is the amount that recombination is modified. We conclude that selection for recombination will be substantial only if there is tight linkage within the genome or if many loci are subject to directional selection as during periods of rapid evolutionary change.},

	abstract = {Non-selective effects, like genetic drift, are an important factor in modern conceptions of evolution, and have been extensively studied for constant population sizes (Kimura, 1955; Otto and Whitlock, 1997). Here, we consider non-selective evolution in the case of growing populations that are of small size and have varying trait compositions (e.g. after a population bottleneck). We find that, in these conditions, populations never fixate to a trait, but tend to a random limit composition, and that the distribution of compositions {\textquotedblleft}freezes{\textquotedblright} to a steady state. This final state is crucially influenced by the initial conditions. We obtain these findings from a combined theoretical and experimental approach, using multiple mixed subpopulations of two Pseudomonas putida strains in non-selective growth conditions (Matthijs et al, 2009) as model system. The experimental results for the population dynamics match the theoretical predictions based on the P{\'o}lya urn model (Eggenberger and P{\'o}lya, 1923) for all analyzed parameter regimes. In summary, we show that exponential growth stops genetic drift. This result contrasts with previous theoretical analyses of non-selective evolution (e.g. genetic drift), which investigated how traits spread and eventually take over populations (fixate) (Kimura, 1955; Otto and Whitlock, 1997). Moreover, our work highlights how deeply growth influences non-selective evolution, and how it plays a key role in maintaining genetic variability. Consequently, it is of particular importance in life-cycles models (Melbinger et al, 2010; Cremer et al, 2011; Cremer et al, 2012) of periodically shrinking and expanding populations.},

The human brain is distinctive in terms of its cognitive abilities as well as its susceptibility to neurological disease. Identifying which of the millions of genomic changes that occurred during human evolution led to these and other uniquely human traits is extremely challenging. Recent studies have demonstrated that many of the fastest evolving regions of the human genome function as gene regulatory enhancers during embryonic development and that the human-specific mutations in them might alter expression patterns. However, elucidating molecular and cellular effects of sequence or expression pattern changes is a major obstacle to discovering the genetic bases of the evolution of our species. There is much work to do before human-specific genetic and genomic changes are linked to complex human traits.

	abstract = {Associations between selected alleles and the genetic backgrounds on which they are found can reduce the efficacy of selection. We consider the extent to which such interference, known as the Hill-Robertson effect, acting between weakly selected alleles, can restrict molecular adaptation and affect patterns of polymorphism and divergence. In particular, we focus on synonymous-site mutations, considering the fate of novel variants in a two-locus model and the equilibrium effects of interference with multiple loci and reversible mutation. We find that weak selection Hill-Robertson (wsHR) interference can considerably reduce adaptation, e.g., codon bias, and, to a lesser extent, levels of polymorphism, particularly in regions of low recombination. Interference causes the frequency distribution of segregating sites to resemble that expected from more weakly selected mutations and also generates specific patterns of linkage disequilibrium. While the selection coefficients involved are small, the fitness consequences of wsHR interference across the genome can be considerable. We suggest that wsHR interference is an important force in the evolution of nonrecombining genomes and may explain the unexpected constancy of codon bias across species of very different census population sizes, as well as several unusual features of codon usage in Drosophila.},

We found 202 genomic elements that are highly conserved in vertebrates but show evidence of significantly accelerated substitution rates in human. These are mostly in non-coding DNA, often near genes associated with transcription and DNA binding. Resequencing confirmed that the five most accelerated elements are dramatically changed in human but not in other primates, with seven times more substitutions in human than in chimp. The accelerated elements, and in particular the top five, show a strong bias for adenine and thymine to guanine and cytosine nucleotide changes and are disproportionately located in high recombination and high guanine and cytosine content environments near telomeres, suggesting either biased gene conversion or isochore selection. In addition, there is some evidence of directional selection in the regions containing the two most accelerated regions. A combination of evolutionary forces has contributed to accelerated evolution of the fastest evolving elements in the human genome.},

Recent work has shown that, among sets of prokaryotic genomes in which most homologous genes show extremely low sequence divergence, gene content can vary enormously, implying that those genes that are variably present or absent are frequently horizontally transferred. Traditionally, successful horizontal gene transfer was assumed to provide a selective advantage to either the host or the gene itself, but could horizontally transferred genes be neutral or nearly neutral? We suggest that for many prokaryotes, the boundaries between species are fuzzy, and therefore the principles of population genetics must be broadened so that they can be applied to higher taxonomic categories.},

	abstract = {In humans, the rate of recombination, as measured on the megabase scale, is positively associated with the level of genetic variation, as measured at the genic scale. Despite considerable debate, it is not clear whether these factors are causally linked or, if they are, whether this is driven by the repeated action of adaptive evolution or molecular processes such as double-strand break formation and mismatch repair. We introduce three innovations to the analysis of recombination and diversity: fine-scale genetic maps estimated from genotype experiments that identify recombination hotspots at the kilobase scale, analysis of an entire human chromosome, and the use of wavelet techniques to identify correlations acting at different scales. We show that recombination influences genetic diversity only at the level of recombination hotspots. Hotspots are also associated with local increases in GC content and the relative frequency of GC-increasing mutations but have no effect on substitution rates. Broad-scale association between recombination and diversity is explained through covariance of both factors with base composition. To our knowledge, these results are the first evidence of a direct and local influence of recombination hotspots on genetic variation and the fate of individual mutations. However, that hotspots have no influence on substitution rates suggests that they are too ephemeral on an evolutionary time scale to have a strong influence on broader scale patterns of base composition and long-term molecular evolution.},

However, this view neglects the necessity of organizing genetic information on a chromosome that needs to be replicated and folded, which may add constraints to single gene evolution. As a consequence, genes are potentially subjected to different mutation and selection pressures, depending on their position in the genome. In this paper, we analyze the structuring of different codon usage measures along completely sequenced bacterial genomes. We show that most of them are highly structured, suggesting that genes have different base content, depending on their location on the chromosome. A peculiar pattern of genome structure, with a tendency toward an A+T-enrichment near the replication terminus, is found in most bacterial phyla and may reflect common chromosome constraints. Several species may have lost this pattern, probably because of genome rearrangements or integration of foreign DNA. We show that in several species, this enrichment is associated with an increase of evolutionary rate and we discuss the evolutionary implications of these results. We argue that structural constraints acting on the circular chromosome are not negligible and that this natural structuring of bacterial genomes may be a cause of overestimation in lateral gene transfer predictions using codon composition indices.},

	abstract = {Bacterial systematics has not yet reached a consensus for defining the fundamental unit of biological diversity, the species. The past half-century of bacterial systematics has been characterized by improvements in methods for demarcating species as phenotypic and genetic clusters, but species demarcation has not been guided by a theory-based concept of species. Eukaryote systematists have developed a universal concept of species: A species is a group of organisms whose divergence is capped by a force of cohesion; divergence between different species is irreversible; and different species are ecologically distinct. In the case of bacteria, these universal properties are held not by the named species of systematics but by ecotypes. These are populations of organisms occupying the same ecological niche, whose divergence is purged recurrently by natural selection. These ecotypes can be discovered by several universal sequence-based approaches. These molecular methods suggest that a typical named species contains many ecotypes, each with the universal attributes of species. A named bacterial species is thus more like a genus than a species.},

In most bacterial genomes, large proportions of genes are introduced by LGT, as indicated by their compositional features and/or phylogenetic distributions, and there is also clear evidence of LGT between very distantly related organisms. By adopting a whole-genome approach, which examined the history of every gene in numerous bacterial genomes, we show that LGT does not hamper phylogenetic reconstruction at many of the shallower taxonomic levels. Despite the high levels of gene acquisition, the only taxonomic group for which appreciable amounts of homologous recombination were detected was within bacterial species. Taken as a whole, the results derived from the analysis of complete gene inventories support several of the current means to recognize and define bacterial species.},

	abstract = {One of the greatest puzzles in evolutionary biology is the high frequency of sexual reproduction and recombination. Given that individuals surviving to reproductive age have genomes that function in their current environment, why should they risk shuffling their genes with those of another individual? Mathematical models are especially important in developing predictions about when sex and recombination can evolve, because it is difficult to intuit the outcome of evolution with several interacting genes. Interestingly, theoretical analyses have shown that it is often quite difficult to identify conditions that favour the evolution of high rates of sex and recombination. For example, fitness interactions among genes (epistasis) can favour sex and recombination but only if such interactions are negative, relatively weak and not highly variable. One reason why an answer to the paradox of sex has been so elusive is that our models have focused unduly on populations that are infinite in size, unstructured and isolated from other species. Yet most verbal theories for sex and recombination consider a finite number of genotypes evolving in a biologically and/or physically complex world. Here, we review various hypotheses for why sex and recombination are so prevalent and discuss theoretical results indicating which of these hypotheses is most promising.},

In the presence of lateral gene transfer, however, this may not be the case, because the species lineage from which a gene was transferred may have gone extinct or not have been sampled. Because it is not feasible to specify or reconstruct the complete phylogeny of all species, we must describe the evolution of genes outside the represented phylogeny by modeling the speciation dynamics that gave rise to the complete phylogeny. We demonstrate that if the number of sampled species is small compared with the total number of existing species, the overwhelming majority of gene transfers involve speciation to and evolution along extinct or unsampled lineages. We show that the evolution of genes along extinct or unsampled lineages can to good approximation be treated as those of independently evolving lineages described by a few global parameters. Using this result, we derive an algorithm to calculate the probability of a gene tree and recover the maximum-likelihood reconciliation given the phylogeny of the sampled species. Examining 473 near-universal gene families from 36 cyanobacteria, we find that nearly a third of transfer events (28\%) appear to have topological signatures of evolution along extinct species, but only approximately 6\% of transfers trace their ancestry to before the common ancestor of the sampled cyanobacteria.

	abstract = {Like organisms from all other walks of life, bacteria are capable of sexual recombination. However, unlike most plants and animals, bacteria recombine only rarely, and when they do they are extremely promiscuous in their choice of sexual partners. There may be no absolute constraints on the evolutionary distances that can be traversed through recombination in the bacterial world, but interspecies recombination is reduced by a variety of factors, including ecological isolation, behavioral isolation, obstacles to DNA entry, restriction endonuclease activity, resistance to integration of divergent DNA sequences, reversal of recombination by mismatch repair, and functional incompatibility of recombined segments. Typically, individual bacterial species are genetically variable for most of these factors. Therefore, natural selection can modulate levels of sexual isolation, to increase the transfer of genes useful to the recipient while minimizing the transfer of harmful genes. Interspecies recombination is optimized when recombination involves short segments that are just long enough to transfer an adaptation, without co-transferring potentially harmful DNA flanking the adaptation. Natural selection has apparently acted to reduce sexual isolation between bacterial species. Evolution of sexual isolation is not a milestone toward speciation in bacteria, since bacterial recombination is too rare to oppose adaptive divergence between incipient species. Ironically, recombination between incipient bacterial species may actually foster the speciation process, by prohibiting one incipient species from out-competing the other to extinction. Interspecific recombination may also foster speciation by introducing novel gene loci from divergent species, allowing invasion of new niches.},

Population genetics models predict a positive correlation between the efficacy of selection at a given locus and the local rate of recombination because of Hill{\textendash}Robertson effects. Codon usage is considered one of the most striking examples that support this prediction at the molecular level. In a wide range of species including Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, codon usage is essentially shaped by selection acting for translational efficiency. Codon usage bias correlates positively with recombination rate in Drosophila, apparently supporting the hypothesis that selection on codon usage is improved by recombination. Here we present an exhaustive analysis of codon usage in C. elegans and D. melanogaster complete genomes. We show that in both genomes there is a positive correlation between recombination rate and the frequency of optimal codons. However, we demonstrate that in both species, this effect is due to a mutational bias toward G and C bases in regions of high recombination rate, possibly as a direct consequence of the recombination process. The correlation between codon usage bias and recombination rate in these species appears to be essentially determined by recombination-dependent mutational patterns, rather than selective effects. This result highlights that it is necessary to take into account the mutagenic effect of recombination to understand the evolutionary role and impact of recombination.},

Despite several decades of research aimed at understanding this wide variation, the forces controlling GC content are not well understood. Recent work has suggested that a universal adenine + thymine (AT) mutational bias exists in all bacteria and that the elevated GC contents found in some bacterial genomes is due to genome-wide selection for increased GC content. These results are generally consistent with the low GC contents observed in most strict endosymbiotic bacterial genomes, where the loss of DNA repair mechanisms combined with the population genetic effects of small effective population sizes and decreased recombination should lower the efficacy of selection and shift the equilibrium GC content in the mutationally favored AT direction. Surprisingly, the two smallest bacterial genomes, Candidatus Hodgkinia cicadicola (144 kb) and Candidatus Tremblaya princeps (139 kb), have the unusual combination of highly reduced genomes and elevated GC contents, raising the possibility that these bacteria may be exceptions to the otherwise apparent universal bacterial AT mutational bias. Here, using population genomic data generated from the Hodgkinia genome project, we show that Hodgkinia has a clear AT mutational bias. These results provide further evidence that an AT mutational bias is universal in bacteria, even in strict endosymbionts with elevated genomic GC contents.},

As a result, homologous recombination mediates the dispersal of advantageous alleles that may rise to high frequency among genetically related individuals via periodic selection events.

We studied the specificity and rate of different mutational biases in real time in the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium under conditions of strongly reduced selection and in the absence of the major DNA repair systems involved in repairing common spontaneous mutations caused by oxidized and deaminated DNA bases. The mutational spectrum was determined by whole-genome sequencing of two S. typhimurium mutants that were serially passaged for 5,000 generations. Analysis of 943 identified base pair substitutions showed that 91\% were GC-to-TA transversions and 7\% were GC-to-AT transitions, commonly associated with 8-oxoG- and deamination-induced damages, respectively. Other types of base pair substitutions constituted the remaining 2\% of the mutations. With regard to mutational biases, there was a significant increase in C-to-T transitions on the nontranscribed strand, and for highly expressed genes, C/G-to-T mutations were more common than expected; however, no significant mutational bias with regard to leading and lagging strands of replication or chromosome position were found. These results suggest that, based on the experimentally determined mutational rates and specificities, a bacterial genome lacking the relevant DNA repair systems could, as a consequence of these underlying mutational biases, very rapidly reduce its GC content.},

	abstract = {Muller{\textquoteright}s ratchet, the inevitable accumulation of deleterious mutations in asexual populations, has been proposed as a major factor in genome degradation of obligate symbiont organisms. Essentially, if left unchecked the ratchet will with certainty cause extinction due to the ever increasing mutational load. This paper examines the evolutionary fate of insect symbionts, using mathematical modelling to simulate the accumulation of deleterious mutations. We investigate the effects of a hierarchical two level population structure. Since each host contains its own subpopulation of symbionts, there will be a large number of small symbiont populations linked indirectly via selection on the host level. We show that although the separate subpopulations will accumulate deleterious mutations quickly, the symbiont population as a whole will be protected from extinction by selection acting on the hosts. As a consequence, the extent of genome degradation observed in present day symbionts is more likely to represent loss of functions that were (near-) neutral to the host, rather than a snap shot of a decline towards complete genetic collapse.},

As part of this process, short deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) tracts of less than 1 kb in length are exchanged between chromosomes in an asymmetric fashion in a process known as gene conversion. When such gene conversion events occur within the vicinity of heterozygous loci, this asymmetric exchange of DNA can result in the non-Mendelian transmission of alleles. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that this non-Mendelian transmission is biased in favour of G and C alleles at the expense of A and T alleles. This process, known as biased gene conversion, has a number of important implications for understanding the behaviour of alleles within a population and the base composition of the genome itself.

Key Concepts:
Key Concepts:




*
Biased gene conversion is the preferential transmission of certain alleles to the next generation, arising from asymmetries in the gene conversion process.


*
Biased gene conversion appears to preferentially favour GC alleles over AT alleles, resulting in the overtransmission of GC alleles in regions of high recombination.


*
Biased gene conversion can increase the frequency of an allele in a population.


*
Consistent biased gene conversion can ultimately influence the base composition of the genome, leading to increased levels of GC content.


*
Although a difficult phenomenon to measure, multiple lines of experimental and evolutionary evidence support the existence of biased gene conversion.},

The results of two tests are inconsistent with the mutation hypothesis in coding, noncoding, CpG-island, and non-CpG-island DNA, but are consistent with selection or biased gene conversion. It is argued that biased gene conversion is unlikely to affect silent site base composition in mammals. The results therefore suggest that selection is acting upon silent site G + C content. This may have broad implications, since silent site base composition reflects large-scale variation in G + C content along mammalian chromosomes. The results therefore suggest that selection may be acting upon the base composition of isochores and large sections of junk DNA.},

The relationship between the silent substitution rate (K s) and the GC content along the genome is a focal point of the debate about the origin of the isochore structure in vertebrates. Recent estimation of the silent substitution rate showed a positive correlation between K s and GC content, in contradiction with the predictions of both the regional mutation bias model and the selection or biased gene conversion model. The aim of this paper is to help resolve this contradiction between theoretical studies and data. We analyzed the relationship between K s and GC content under (1) uniform mutation bias, (2) a regional mutation bias, and (3) mutation bias and selection. We report that an increase in K s with GC content is expected under mutation bias because of either nonequilibrium of the isochore structure or an increasing mutation rate from AT toward GC nucleotides in GC-richer isochores. We show by simulations that CpG deamination tends to increase the mutation rate with GC content in a regional mutation bias model. We also demonstrate that the relationship between K s and GC under the selectionist or biased gene conversion model is positive under weak selection if the mutation selection equilibrium GC frequency is less than 0.5.},

Mammalian genomes show large-scale regional variations of GC-content (the isochores), but the substitution processes at the origin of this structure are poorly understood. We have analyzed the pattern of neutral substitutions in 14.3 Mb of primate noncoding regions. We show that the GC-content toward which sequences are evolving is strongly correlated (r2 = 0.61, P <= 2 10-16) with the rate of crossovers (notably in females). This demonstrates that recombination drives the evolution of base composition in human (probably via the process of biased gene conversion). The present substitution patterns are very different from what they had been in the past, resulting in a major modification of the isochore structure of our genome. This non-equilibrium situation suggests that changes of recombination rates occur relatively frequently during evolution, possibly as a consequence of karyotype rearrangements. These results have important implications for understanding the spatial and temporal variations of substitution processes in a broad range of sexual organisms, and for detecting the hallmarks of natural selection in DNA sequences.},

	abstract = {Author Summary{\textless}p{\textgreater}Recombination is a fundamental component of mammalian meiosis, required to help ensure that daughter cells receive the correct complement of chromosomes. This is highly important, as incorrect segregation causes miscarriage and disorders such as Down syndrome. In addition to its mechanistic function, recombination is also crucial in generating the genetic diversity on which natural selection acts. In humans and many other species, recombination events cluster into narrow hotspots within the genome. Given the vital role recombination plays in meiosis, we might expect that the positions of these hotspots would be tightly conserved over evolutionary time. However, there is now considerable evidence to the contrary; hotspots are not frozen in place, but instead evolve rapidly. For example, humans and chimpanzees do not share hotspot locations, despite their genomic sequences being almost 99\% identical. The explanation for this may be, remarkably, that hotspots are the architects of their own destruction. The biological mechanism of recombination dooms them to rapid extinction by favoring the spread of hotspot-disrupting mutations. By mathematically modeling human hotspot evolution, we find that this mechanism can account for fast hotspot turnover, and in fact makes it very difficult for active hotspots to arise at all. Given that active hotspots do exist in our genome, newly arising hotspots must somehow be able to bypass their self-destructive tendency. Despite their importance, it is difficult to identify mutations that disrupt hotspots, as they hide their tracks in genetic data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/sec{\textgreater}},

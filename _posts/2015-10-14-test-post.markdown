Following the advice of 
[Andy Hunt](http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Thinking-Learning-Refactor-Programmers/dp/1934356050),
I decided to start a blog. I want to be able to communicate my ideas in the most
limpid way. Being a non-native English speaker, it is crucial for me to get used
to write in English. 

# Goal

I am currently learning population genomics, applied to microbial communities.
Me and my supervisors are studying a biased gene conversion process in bacteria,
using a natural transformation model of recombination : *Acinetobacter*.

I have never been exposed to such concepts, yet they seem really appealing to
me. I want to be able to put some clear reasoning on concepts I have learned so
far. Writing a blog is perfect for that. 

# An aspiring bacterial evolutionnist

Here I'll try to expose stuff that I learned during my late readings and
research paper gamblingâ€¦

I mostly do microbiology and evolution on a computer, using `R` and `Python`,
and I try my best to be good at it. I'll certainly blog on it sometimes. 

I also loves [Emacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs), on which I'll try
to blog some other times.

Base composition of genomes is affected by many major process, being either
neutral or selective. The neutral model describes mutations as following the
genetic drift, which depends on population effective size. It does not represent
the genome reality very well, but it is a useful model as a null hypothesis. One
must reject the neutral hypothesis before affirming that a genomic trait is under
selection constraints.

# Natural Selection hypothesis

The natural selection hypothesis discriminate three cases of a genomic trait
being under selective constraints. The positive or directional selection leads
to the gradual erasing of variation on a given position of the genome, if this
position has a positive impact on the fitness. The purifying, or negative
selection, act against all variation, nearly all mutation are deleterious.
Typically, a mutation on conserved region of 16S rDNA in Bacteria are
deleterious : they does not spread in the population.

Recently, a new process that can confound selection tracks with a neutral
process has been discovered : the biased gene conversion.

# Gene conversion

A gene conversion event takes place when the resolution of the intermediate
poroduct of homolog recombination leads to the
uni-directional—non-reciprocal—exchange of genetic information from one donor to
a receptor sequence. It is a key process of the first meiosis division, an
obligate step in eukaryotes gametogenesis.

Nevertheless, if one allele has a greater chance to be the donor, the process is
biased.

# Biased Gene Conversion

There are two main scenarios to explain a biased gene conversion event.

## Initiation bias

The initiation bias appears when a region on one double stranded DNA is more
often victim of double strand breaks than its homolog region on the sister
chromosome. This region is thus called a recombination hotspots, whereas its
homolog on the sister chromosome is called a recombination coldspots.
Paradoxically, on the lifespan of the hotspot, the coldspot will more often be
the donor of gene conversion events, leading to the gradual death of the
corresponding hotspot. There is an initiation bias on the gene conversion event.

## GC-biased gene conversion

The other bias is called GC-bias gene conversion. Indeed, it has been shown in
many eukaryotes, including yeast and human, that the G or C alleles of a gene
are statistically significantly more often the donor of a gene conversion event
than its A or T corresponding allele.

> It looks exactly as directed selection, but is *not* an adaptative process.

One can find traces of GC-bias gene conversion in a region if all positions are
affected, being either neutral or _even deleterious_. Typically, gBGC is
associated with regions of high rate of recombination, actual or past. While
selection only act on non neutral regions[^3], gBGC also acts on nearby introns
and non-functional sequences. Moreover, selection can act on a very large
genomic scale, when linkage is taken into account.


----------

gBGC has been shown to be responsible for the large scale variations of
GC-content, the so called genomic isochores; it can lead to the fixation of
deleterious mutations; and it can confound traces of selection.

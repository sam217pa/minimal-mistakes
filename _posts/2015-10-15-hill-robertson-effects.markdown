Hill-Robertson effects are interference between two locus under selection, when
the two locus are not or marginally affected by recombination.

# Directional selection

It is a special case of linkage, where two alleles under
positive—directional—selection are competing for the selective sweep. The
optimal combination is never reached, in the absence of recombination.

In a population of resident, *A* and *B* are two loci under positive selection,
*a* and *b* are the two respective selected loci in the mutant. The optimal
genotype would then be *ab*. But *a* and *B* are in link disequilibrium, and *A*
and *b* too. This is a case of the so called genetic hitch-hiking[^1], of *A*
for *b* or *B* for *a*. This lead to a competition for the selective sweep
occurring after the invasion of *aB* or *Ab* in the population. In the absence
of recombination, one can never obtain the optimal *ab*.

In this context, selection is clearly more efficient in region of high
recombination rate. In the absence of recombination, selection can only act on
one allele, leading to selective sweep competition, or Hill-Robertson effect. 

# Background selection

Let us consider a deleterious allele. The selection is now negative, or
purifying, leading to the progressive erasure of the allele from the genetic
pool. All genes and loci being currently linked to this specific allele would be
erased as well from the genetic pool. It can be so even in cases where the
linked locus is either neutral, or positively selected. The advantageous effects
of the positively selected allele would have to be less beneficial than losing the
deleterious allele for this to occur.

# Conclusion

Selective sweep leads to the erasure of the pre-existing variation at a given
locus, whereas background selection decreases the local polymorphism rate of the
genes and neutral regions linked to the selected locus.

Linkage thus plays a role on interference between loci under selection.
Multi-loci natural selection is the most efficient when acting on independent
loci.

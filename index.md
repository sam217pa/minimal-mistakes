# An aspiring bacterial evolutionnist

Here I'll try to expose stuff that I learned during my late readings and
research paper gamblingâ€¦

I mostly do microbiology and evolution on a computer, using `R` and `Python`,
and I try my best to be good at it.

I also loves Emacs, on which I'll try to blog sometimes.
